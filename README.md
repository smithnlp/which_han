# which_han
This is a super-simple tool intended for learners of Chinese who are far along enough to *know what they don't know*. It's a utility that uses linguistic features to decipher non-standard Mandarin on the web and explain why it's different. The idea is that if you come across Chinese text that you can tell is __not__ standard Mandarin Putonghua, paste it into this program and it will explain dialect characters, grammar, etc.

## Usage
__Requirements__
* Python 3+

__Command line usage__


```
$ python3 which_han.py
```
Running the program in this way opens a live prompt which allows you to paste in whatever excerpt of Chinese text about which you have suspicions regarding dialect characters.

### Han dialect support
* Yue (Cantonese)
* Wu (Shanghainese)

### Where you might come across dialect writing
* online [forums](https://www.shanghaining.com/forum-3-1.html)
* some blogs
* there are dialect wikipedia's for [Yue](https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/), [Wu](https://wuu.wikipedia.org/wiki), and [Gan](https://gan.wikipedia.org/wiki)
