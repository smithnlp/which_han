This is a super-simple tool intended for learners of Chinese who are far along enough to *know what they don't know*. It's a utility that uses linguistic features to decipher non-standard Mandarin on the web and explain why it's different. The idea is that if you come across Chinese text that you can tell is __not__ standard Mandarin Putonghua, paste it into this program and it will explain dialect characters, grammar, etc.

### Han dialect support
