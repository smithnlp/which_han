# which_han
This is a super-simple tool intended for learners of Chinese who are far along enough to *know what they don't know*. The idea is that if you come across Chinese text that you can tell is __not__ standard Mandarin Putonghua, paste it into this program and it will explain dialect characters, grammar, etc.

### Han dialect support
* Yue (Cantonese)
* Wu (Shanghainese)
And maybe
* Gan

### Where you might come across dialect writing
* online forums
* some blogs
* there are dialect wikipedia's for [Yue](https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/), [Wu](https://wuu.wikipedia.org/wiki), and [Gan](https://gan.wikipedia.org/wiki)
